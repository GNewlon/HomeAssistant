* Create Home Assistant webhooks and handle them in Node-RED
* Use Device triggers and action from Node-RED

## Minimum Requirements

* [node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket](https://github.com/zachowj/node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket) v0.20+

## Installation

### HACS

Install via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) (Home Assistant Community Store)

1. Go to HACS -> Integrations -> "+ Explore & Download Repos"
1. Find "Node-RED Companion".
1. Open the search result and click "Download this Repository with HACS".
1. Refresh your browser window (bug in HA where it doesn't update the integration list after a reboot)
1. In the Home Assistant UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Node-RED" [![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=nodered)

### Manual

1. Using your tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
1. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
1. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `nodered`.
1. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/nodered/` directory (folder) in this repository.
1. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
1. Restart Home Assistant
1. Refresh your browser window (bug in HA where it doesn't update the integration list after a reboot)
1. In the Home Assistant UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Node-RED" [![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=nodered)


    Using your HA configuration directory (folder) as a starting point you should have this:

    ```text
    custom_components/nodered/translations/en.json
    custom_components/nodered/__init__.py
    custom_components/nodered/binary_sensor.py
    custom_components/nodered/config_flow.py
    custom_components/nodered/const.py
    custom_components/nodered/discovery.py
    custom_components/nodered/manifest.json
    custom_components/nodered/sensor.py
    custom_components/nodered/services.yaml
    custom_components/nodered/switch.py
    custom_components/nodered/websocket.py
    ```


## Configuration

Once installed and added via Home-Assistant Integrations all configuration is done from within Node-RED.
